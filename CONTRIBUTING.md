# Contributing to EthicApp: overall project management

This document contains general information about how the development team is organized for performing changes to the EthicApp project. If you intend to contribute, please read [the main project's CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then, head back to this document to let you know about the communication channels for the team.

## 1. Communication channels

### 1.1. GitHub

Of course, for code reviewing, issuing and committing will take place at the project's repositories.

### 1.2. Discord

For a very organized, flexible, but also natural way to discuss, record progress at a broad level and solve questions. You can join the project discord server from [this invite link](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx). You will be able to see various channels for discussion, and a single voice channel for scheduled real-time meetings.

### 1.3. Mailing list

There is a Google Group (mailing list) named "EthicApp Development" whose members will receive emails for important announcements from the Discord server (i.e. posts at the `#anuncios-globales` channel). Active developers will be invited to this mailing list.

## 2. Planning and tracking changes

<!-- TODO: update this section with the Sheet/Excel file for tracking changes and similar... -->

This section is intended for maintainers. User stories will be stored at a MS Excel (or equivalent) file in a shared Google Drive folder, where the maintainer is the person able to update it. The maintainer will also create and update tasks from the user stories, and manage them at a Trello dashboard, where every task can be assigned to a team member. Then, issues will be created accordingly at the GitHub repository, where these will be addressed by contributors.

Finally, scheduled team meetings for important decisions will be announced on [EthicApp's Discord server](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx) and will take place over the corresponding voice channel.
