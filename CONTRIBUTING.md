# Contributing to EthicApp: overall project management

This document contains general information about how the development team is organized for performing changes to the EthicApp project. If you intend to contribute, please read [the main project's CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then, head back to this document to let you know about the communication channels for the team.

## 1. Communication channels

### 1.1. GitHub

Of course, for code reviewing, issuing and committing will take place at the project's repositories.

### 1.2. Discord

For a very organized, flexible, but also natural way to discuss, record progress at a broad level and solve questions. You can join the project discord server from [this invite link](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx). You will be able to see various channels for discussion, and a single voice channel for scheduled real-time meetings.

### 1.3. Mailing list

There is a Google Group (mailing list) named "EthicApp Development" whose members will receive emails for important announcements from the Discord server (i.e. posts at the `#anuncios-globales` channel). Active developers will be invited to this mailing list.

## 2. Planning and tracking changes

The strategic objectives of EthicApp's roadmap(s) should be publicly visible in this repository (e.g. at [`Milestones/`](./Milestones/)). It is also recommended to keep track of progress of the roadmap(s) using free platforms such as [Linear](https://linear.app).

From the roadmap, with additional documents such as user stories, maintainers, along with the [BDFL](./GOVERNANCE.md#1-benevolent-dictator-for-life-bdfl), will create issues oriented to the roadmap, which will be assigned to contributors accordingly[^1]. These issues will be addressed following our [Git workflow guidelines](./Guidelines/git-workflow.md), via proper *pull requests*. Note that EthicApp makes use of [GitHub projects](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/projects?query=is%3Aopen), an useful tool for working towards the roadmap.

[^1]: While this is an open source project, it is likely for most of the work to be done by Universidad de los Andes's students, as part of their dissertation or professional practice. For this *internal contributors*, they will be simply assigned to issues related to their academic work. For *external contributors*, coordination with the maintainer is needed to assign the issues they would like to work on.

Finally, scheduled team meetings for important decisions will be announced on [EthicApp's Discord server](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx) and will take place over the corresponding voice channel.
