# Contributing to EthicApp: overall project management

<!-- TODO: make sure to update the link to the CONTRIBUTING doc for when it is merged into master branch! -->

This document contains general information about how the development team is organized for performing changes to the EthicApp project. If you intend to contribute, please read [the main project's CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/blob/ci-config/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then, head back to this document to let you know about the communication channels for the team.

## Communication channels

### GitHub

Of course, for code reviewing, issuing and committing will take place at the project's repositories.

### Discord

For a very organized, flexible, but also natural way to discuss, record progress at a broad level and solve questions. You can join the project discord server from [this invite link](https://discord.gg/SwA7MVgu). You will be able to see various channels for discussion, and a single voice channel for scheduled real-time meetings.

<!-- ### Mailing list
A mailing list, where important announcements, such as scheduled real-time meetings, are delivered to all contributors of the project. -->
<!-- TODO: setup a way to subscribe to the mailing list. Cannot use Google Groups, due Uandes' Gsuite settings... Besides, there are no free and reliable alternatives to Google Groups... -->

## Planning and tracking changes

This section is intended for maintainers. User stories will be stored at a MS Excel (or equivalent) file in a shared Google Drive folder, where the maintainer is the person able to update it. The maintainer will also create and update tasks from the user stories, and manage them at a Trello dashboard, where every task can be assigned to a team member. Then, issues will be created accordingly at the GitHub repository, where these will be addressed by contributors.

Finally, when scheduling team meeting for important decisions (which will be announced on the project's mailing list), it will take place over the voice channel on [EthicApp's Discord server](https://discord.gg/SwA7MVgu).
