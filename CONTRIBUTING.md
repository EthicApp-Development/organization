# Contributing to EthicApp: overall project management

<!-- TODO: make sure to update the link to the CONTRIBUTING doc for when it is merged into master branch! -->

This document contains general information about how the development team is organized for performing changes to the EthicApp project. If you intend to contribute, please read [the main project's CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/blob/ci-config/CONTRIBUTING.md). Then, head back to this document to let you know about the communication channels for the team.

## 1. Communication channels

### 1.1. GitHub

Of course, for code reviewing, issuing and committing will take place at the project's repositories.

### 1.2. Discord

For a very organized, flexible, but also natural way to discuss, record progress at a broad level and solve questions. You can join the project discord server from [this invite link](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx). You will be able to see various channels for discussion, and a single voice channel for scheduled real-time meetings.

<!-- ### Mailing list
A mailing list, where important announcements, such as scheduled real-time meetings, are delivered to all contributors of the project. -->
<!-- TODO: setup a way to subscribe to the mailing list. Cannot use Google Groups, due Uandes' Gsuite settings... Besides, there are no free and reliable alternatives to Google Groups... -->

## 2. Planning and tracking changes

This section is intended for maintainers. User stories will be stored at a MS Excel (or equivalent) file in a shared Google Drive folder, where the maintainer is the person able to update it. The maintainer will also create and update tasks from the user stories, and manage them at a Trello dashboard, where every task can be assigned to a team member. Then, issues will be created accordingly at the GitHub repository, where these will be addressed by contributors.

Finally, scheduled team meetings for important decisions will be announced on [EthicApp's Discord server](https://discord.gg/w3MD6eX2Cx) and will take place over the corresponding voice channel.
