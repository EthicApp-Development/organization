# Contributing

(temporal? file with notes)

Each of EthicApp's projects in theory will have different skill requirements for developers, so probably there shouldn't be a CONTRIBUTING file at organization level, as these projects may be in different frameworks indeed.

Don't forget to suggest in the CONTRIBUTING file to look at issues labeled `good first issue` and/or `help wanted`, similarly to [`vscode`'s contribution guide](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
