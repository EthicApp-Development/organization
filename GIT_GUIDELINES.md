## 1. Issuing

This section explain how and when to create issues in the [EthicApp's GitHub project repository](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main). The language of all issues will be **SPANISH**, unlike the rest of all documentation and code. This will make confusions less likely and will make it easier to post a bug report or other kind of issues for local contributors, as was started and will continue development on spanish-speaker universities (at Chile).

<!-- TODO: define overall issue title format and its minimum content, including scope (not vague issues) -->

### 1.1. Bug reports

> A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!

Before submitting a bug report, please search in the existing issues, as someone else could have reported the problem already. Once you have decided to submit a report, go to [issues](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/issues) and hit the "New issue" button. Then, select click "*Reporte de error*" and enter the required information on that template.

Example:

TODO <!-- TODO: include a good actual example, as a screenshot -->

### 1.2. Feature requests

For posting a request for a new feature in the platform, first search in the existing issues and make sure nobody as already asked for such feature. For creating a new feature request, similarly to [when submitting a bug report](#11-bug-reports), select "*Nueva característica*" when creating the issue and fill the required fields.

Example:

TODO <!-- TODO: include a good actual example, as a screenshot -->

### 1.3. Questions and discussions

(internal development scope?)

<!-- TODO: describe how to make a question/start a discussion, using a proper issue label -->

## 6. Appendix: references

The issues guidelines were inspired from [Nicolas Gallagher's `issue-guidelines` project](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Microsoft's [PowerToys issue templates](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) for GitHub were used as reference to [EthicApp's issue templates](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) (main repository).
