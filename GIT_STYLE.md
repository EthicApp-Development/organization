## 1. Issuing

This section explain how and when to create issues in [EthicApp's GitHub project repository](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main). The language of all issues will be **SPANISH**, unlike the rest of all documentation and code. This will make confusions less likely and will make it easier to post a bug report or other kind of issues, as the organization members are all (supposed to be) spanish-speakers.

<!-- TODO: define overall issue title format and its minimum content, including scope (not vague issues) -->

<!-- ? what about specific "tasks/to-do" issues? do we need another category for it? make it clear -->

### 1.1. Bug reports

> A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!

Before submitting a bug report, please search in the existing issues, as someone else could have reported the problem already. Once you have decided to submit a report, go to [issues](https://github.com/EthicApp-Development/ethicapp-main/issues) and hit the "New issue" button. Then, select click "*Reporte de error*" and enter the required information on that template.

Example:

TODO <!-- TODO: include a good actual example, as a screenshot -->

### 1.2. Feature requests

For posting a request for a new feature in the platform, first search in the existing issues and make sure nobody as already asked for such feature. For creating a new feature request, similarly to [when submitting a bug report](#11-bug-reports), select "*Nueva característica*" when creating the issue and fill the required fields.

Example:

TODO <!-- TODO: include a good actual example, as a screenshot -->

### 1.3. Pull requests

TODO <!-- TODO -->
