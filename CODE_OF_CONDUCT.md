# Code of conduct

This project adopts [CNSF's Community Code of Conduct v1.2](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/d1aa4b995b2eb6a665a0bf0c76f609508d6ec15a/code-of-conduct.md). Members that violate this code of conduct must be reported to a [maintainer](./GOVERNANCE.md#maintainer) or the [BDFL](./GOVERNANCE.md#benevolent-dictator-for-life-bdfl), and will be sanctioned accordingly.

## Respect to the maintainer

It is important to note that, while the majority of contributors to this project are students working on their thesis (dissertation), it is essential that all contributors respect the decisions made by the maintainers (which are also students). The [governance](./GOVERNANCE.md) hierarchy has to be followed, despite the academic nature in the development of EthicApp.

## Reporting guidelines

If you are a witness of a member that violates this code of conduct, please contact the [BDFL](./GOVERNANCE.md#benevolent-dictator-for-life-bdfl) including the following information:

1. Your contact info (email or similar, so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
2. GitHub usernames of all individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
3. Date and time of the incident, as well as details of the platform in which this happened (e.g. GitHub, another messaging platform, IRL location, etc.).
4. Your testimony of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
5. Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
6. If you believe this incident is ongoing.
7. Any other information you believe we should have.

We will address the report and you will be notified with updates of the case.

Note: this quick report guideline was highly inspired in [Django's code of conduct reporting guide](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/).
