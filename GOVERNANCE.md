# Governance

The EthicApp organization will follow a *founder-leader* model defined at [this RedHat's blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models), with the teacher/researcher in charge is the BDFL, as this is a research project based on a teacher-student approach, where contributors will be mostly students from [Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uandes.cl/) working as part of their professional practices or career dissertation under the teacher's supervision and guidance.

The roles of EthicApp's project(s) are defined as follows. After reading them, please go to our [Git guidelines](./Guidelines/git-workflow.md) to understand how contributions are made and accepted.

For checking contributions of historical relevant contributors and students, please go to [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS](./ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md).

## 2. Maintainer

## 3. Contributor

Contributors are able to solve bug reports or address feature requests, whose work is reviewed by the maintainer(s). Even small contributions like typos help, thank you.
