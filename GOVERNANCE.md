# Governance

The EthicApp organization will follow a _founder-leader_ model defined at [this RedHat's blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models), which in short states that the person that starts the project is the same that administers it and overall decides the direction of it, in this case the teacher/researcher in charge is the [BDFL](#benevolent-dictator-for-life-bdfl), as this is a research project based on a teacher-student approach, where contributors will be mostly students from [Universidad de los Andes](https://www.uandes.cl/) working as part of their professional practices or career dissertation under the teacher's supervision and guidance.

The roles of EthicApp's project(s) are defined below. After reading them, please go to our [Git guidelines](./Guidelines/git-workflow.md) to understand how contributions are made and accepted.

For checking contributions of historical relevant contributors and students, please go to [ACKNOWLEDGMENTS](./ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md).
