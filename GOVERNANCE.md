# Governance

The EthicApp organization will follow a *founder-leader* model defined in [this RedHat's blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models), with the teacher/researcher in charge is the BDFL, as this is a research project based on a teacher-student approach, where contributors will be mostly [Uandes](https://www.uandes.cl/)' students working as part of their professional practices or career dissertation under the teacher's (his) supervision and guidance.

The roles of EthicApp's project(s) are defined as follows.

## 1. Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)

[Claudio Álvarez](https://github.com/claudio-alvarez)

The owner of the project and the individual with the ability to unilaterally make decisions and solve conflicts so as for the project to achieve its goals and eventually evolve. The BDFL can also add or remove other members.

## 2. Maintainer

[Ignacio F. Garcés](https://github.com/ifgarces)

Organizes other developers, manages documentation and performs code reviews on commits, maintaining the expected quality standards and ensuring the project is being lead towards its goals.

## 3. Contributor

Core Uandes' members:

- [Natalia Espínola](https://github.com/NataliaEspinola)
- [Santiago Figueroa](https://github.com/SantiagoFigueroaMc)
- [Matías Rivera](https://github.com/MatiasRiveraC)

Active developer of the project, with enough skills for making significant changes, enhancements and bug fixes directly on code, and suggest documentation updates. Contributors are able to solve bug reports or address feature requests, whose work is reviewed by the maintainer(s). Even small contributions like typos help, thank you.
